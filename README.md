# 🏦 Eventz Banking Demo

This project demonstrates a **simplified distributed banking system** built using the [Eventz](https://eventzapi.com) methodology:  
**`y = F(Y, e)`** — where each function `F` processes a new event `e` and the archive `Y` to produce a new immutable result `y`.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Simulates a basic banking system with:

- ✅ Customers, Accounts, and Cards
- 💰 Deposits and Withdrawals
- 💳 Card Payments
- 🚫 Account/Card Blocking
- 🧾 Immutable audit trail exported as `Y_archive.tsv`

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

Traditional systems are overloaded with:
- Databases, microservices, and APIs
- Coupling and complex state management
- Expensive CQRS/event sourcing boilerplate

**Eventz solves this** with:
- ✅ No database
- ✅ No state to reload
- ✅ Just pure functions and immutable tuples

---

## 🛠 How It Works

Each Python file is a pure Function `F`:
- Reads `Y` (tuple archive)
- Applies business rules to a new event `e`
- Publishes a new `y` back to the archive

Example:
```python
F_withdrawal({'account_uuid': 'acct001', 'amount': 50.0})
````

## 📁 Project Structure

```
eventzAPI.py        # Tuple archive and helper logic
main.py             # Scenario runner
F_*.py              # Procedural Functions (F) for each business rule
Y_archive.tsv       # Optional export of all tuples
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Simulation

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You'll see:

* Transactions approved/declined
* Business rules applied
* Immutable tuple log exported

## 🗂 Example Tuples (TSV format)

| event\_type         | account\_uuid | amount | reason             |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| AccountOpened       | acct001       | 200.0  |                    |
| DepositMade         | acct001       | 100.0  |                    |
| WithdrawalMade      | acct001       | 50.0   |                    |
| TransactionDeclined | acct001       | 300.0  | Insufficient funds |
